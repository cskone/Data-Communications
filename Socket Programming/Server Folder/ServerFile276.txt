Bask, ye samplers, bask in the light
Space is dark, but the star is bright
Bask in the heat of the distant sun
It's gonna get hotter before we're done
So bask in the heat of the sun, boys
Bask in the heat of the sun!

We mine the neutron matter from the heart of a living star
Remotes can't pass magnetic fields, machines can't go that far
So we must ply our samplers to the edge of the stellar core
And there release the drone ships to collect our neutron ore

Bask, ye samplers, bask in the light
Space is dark, but the star is bright
Bask in the heat of the distant sun
It's gonna get hotter before we're done
So bask in the heat of the sun, boys
Bask in the heat of the sun!

A starship's drive is a neutron drive, and it pushes the speed of light
The starships fly to the distant stars, we fly to the star in sight
From cool and green to heat obscene we cross in the work we do
We do it well and we brave this hell for the sake of the starship crew

Bask, ye samplers, bask in the light
Space is dark, but the star is bright
Bask in the heat of the distant sun
It's gonna get hotter before we're done
So bask in the heat of the sun, boys
Bask in the heat of the sun!

A million miles to the core and back, in the heat of the fusion glow
All mankind thrives on the lives we need, but only the samplers go
If not for the neutrons we return, the starships could not run
And so we mine like our fathers mined, and bask in the heat of the sun

Bask, ye samplers, bask in the light
Space is dark, but the star is bright
Bask in the heat of the distant sun
It's gonna get hotter before we're done
So bask in the heat of the sun, boys
Bask in the heat of the sun, boys
Bask in the heat of the sun!
